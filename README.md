10/22 @ 9:30p - I have attempted to push another attempt at the trivia game but received the same error over and over and over...

"hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
